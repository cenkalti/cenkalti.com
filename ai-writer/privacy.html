<h2>AI Writer Privacy Policy</h2>

<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>AI Writer is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains our approach to data and privacy to reassure our users about the security of their information.</p>

<h3>No Data Collection:</h3>
<p>AI Writer does not collect or store any personal data from its users. All interactions with the app are processed locally on the user's device.</p>

<h3>Interactions with OpenAI API:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The app sends text selections directly to the OpenAI API for processing based on the user's instructions.</li>
<li>Users must provide their own OpenAI API key, which the app uses to communicate with OpenAI services. This key is not collected, stored, or shared by AI Writer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>User Responsibilities:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Users are responsible for the security of their OpenAI API key and for any data they choose to process through the app.</li>
<li>It is the user's responsibility to adhere to OpenAI's terms of service and privacy policy when using their API.</li>
</ul>

<h3>No Sharing of Information:</h3>
<p>Since AI Writer does not collect data, there is no sharing or disclosure of personal information to third parties.</p>

<h3>Data Security:</h3>
<ul>
<li>As the app operates entirely offline except for its communication with the OpenAI API, data security is largely dependent on the user's device security measures.</li>
<li>Users are encouraged to keep their devices and access credentials secure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Policy Updates:</h3>
<p>This privacy policy may be updated to reflect changes to our operations or changes in the law. Users are encouraged to review this policy periodically.</p>
